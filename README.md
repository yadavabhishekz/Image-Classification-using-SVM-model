# Image-Classification-using-SVM-model

copy all the folders which are in the images_dataset to the /model/dataset folder (with cropped2 folder), so that code can take input from there or you can change the path in the code to images_dataset folder

i have provided my cropped folder in which i have cleaned them manually after the automation
